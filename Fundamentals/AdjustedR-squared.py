Problem Statement
===============================
Given the train and test data, fit a linear regression model on the train data and calculate the adjusted R-squared rounded up to 2 decimal places on the test data for this model.

===============================
Input Format:
===============================
4 lists representing the xtrain, ytrain, xtest and test.

===============================
Output Format:
===============================
A float rounded up to 2 decimal places

===============================
Sample Input:
